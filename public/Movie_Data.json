    "year": 1994,
    "description": "Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a genre-defining crime film that weaves together multiple interrelated narratives in a non-linear format. The story follows a pair of philosophical hitmen, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, as they carry out missions for their boss, Marsellus Wallace. Alongside them, we meet Butch Coolidge, a disillusioned boxer who defies Wallace's orders, and Mia Wallace, the enigmatic wife of the mob boss, whose night out with Vincent takes a dark turn. The film also features a couple of petty thieves who attempt to rob a diner, unknowingly stepping into a much larger world of chaos. Known for its sharp, pop-culture-laced dialogue, graphic violence, dark humor, and iconic performances by John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a bold exploration of crime, consequence, and redemption. Its unconventional structure and stylized storytelling helped redefine modern American cinema, earning it the Palme d'Or at Cannes and cementing Tarantino's status as a visionary filmmaker.",

    "title": "Django Unchained",
    "year": 2012,
    "description": "Django Unchained (2012), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a bold and provocative revisionist Western set in the antebellum American South. The film follows Django, a formerly enslaved man portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who is freed by Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter played by Christoph Waltz. Schultz enlists Django as a partner, and together they track down and eliminate dangerous fugitives. As Django hones his skills, he remains focused on his ultimate goal — rescuing his wife, Broomhilda, from the clutches of Calvin Candie, a cruel and sadistic plantation owner played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Known for its intense performances, especially by Waltz (who won an Academy Award), and its blend of stylized violence, sharp dialogue, and social commentary, Django Unchained is both a brutal tale of vengeance and a subversive take on the traditional Western. It explores themes of justice, identity, and freedom while unapologetically confronting the horrors of slavery through Tarantino’s signature cinematic style.",

    "year": 2009,
    "description": "Inglourious Basterds (2009), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a daring alternate-history war film that reimagines World War II with bold revisionist flair. The story unfolds through two intersecting plots: one led by a covert team of Jewish-American soldiers known as The Basterds headed by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who launch a brutal campaign of guerrilla warfare and Nazi scalping across occupied France; and the other centered on Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a young Jewish cinema owner who seeks revenge for the slaughter of her family by the infamous Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). As the Nazi high command, including Hitler himself, prepares to attend a film premiere at Shosanna’s theater, the Basterds and Shosanna unknowingly move toward the same explosive goal: the annihilation of the Third Reich. With a masterful blend of suspense, dark humor, multilingual dialogue, and a breakout performance by Waltz (who won an Oscar for the role), the film showcases Tarantino's trademark storytelling while offering a uniquely stylized take on vengeance and resistance.",
